101   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - (ANOTHER) DAY            101

      Jordan, Max and securities lawyer MANNY RISKIN exit the
      kitchen with coffees.

                               MANNY RISKIN
                 I'm telling you -- piss on the
                 SEC's leg, you'll end up with your
                 tits in a ringer.

      FREEZE FRAME - Manny stuffs a cruller into his mouth.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 My securities attorney, Manny
                 Riskin. Seven hundred an hour to                    *
                 be the voice of doom.

      BACK TO SCENE

                               JORDAN
                 It's under control. Will you
                 relax already?
                                                         53.

Just then, Max spots a BROKER break-dancing as three
other Brokers look on...

                               MAX
                 What the fuck is this imbecile
                 doing?!

Max crosses off, starts screaming at the break-dancing
Broker. Jordan keeps walking with Manny.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 The SEC sent two lawyers down to
                 review our files, so I set them
                 up in our conference room.

Jordan passes the conference room, looks in the window--
two SEC ATTORNEYS wear coats as they review documents.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 Then I had it bugged and the air
                 conditioning locked till it felt
                 like Antarctica in there.

One of the SEC Attorneys blows into his hands for warmth.
Manny follows Jordan toward the bullpen, his frenzied
Brokers working the phones.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 So here they were, looking for a
                 smoking gun while I was firing a
                 bazooka right under their noses.
                 It was our first IPO, and we were
                 driving the stock price to the
                 fucking moon.

                               BROKER #1
                 Arncliffe National, it's on fire!

                               BROKER #2
                    (voice lowered)
                 Believe me, your grandkids will
                 thank you.

                               BROKER #3
                     (to Sales Assistant)
                 Arncliffe National, ten thousand
                 shares!

Jordan speaks directly to camera as he continues walking
through the bullpen.

                               JORDAN
                 See an IPO is an initial public
                 offering, the first time a stock
                 is offered for sale to the general
                 population.
                                                                54.

                 As the firm taking the company
                 public, we set the initial price,
                 then sold those shares back to --                   *

                 following what I'm saying. The                      *
                 question is, "was it legal?"                        *
                 Absolutely not. But we were making                  *
                 more money that we knew what to do                  *

103    INT. BANK - SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT - DAY      (OCT `92)            103

       Alone in a private room, Jordan unloads a small suitcase
       filled with stacks and stacks of hundred dollar bills.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 But I figured it out.                               *

       CLOSE ON - a huge diamond engagement ring.

                               NAOMI (O.C.)
                 Omigod!!


104    INT. FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT - NIGHT      (OCT `92)            104

       Jordan is down on one knee, proposing; Naomi
       hyperventilates as he puts the ring on her finger -- a
       seven carat, yellow canary diamond in a platinum setting.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 I held my bachelor party at the
                 Tangiers in Las Vegas -- one last                   *
                 blowout for the Gods before I
                 settled down for good.

106    INT. TRANS CAPITAL AIRLINES - JUMBO JET - NIGHT                *106

       Inside a jumbo jet, a wild, mid-air party is in progress.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 A hundred Strattonites flew in
                 with fifty hookers and enough
                 drugs to open a pharmacy.
                                                               55.

      Various images -- Stratton Brokers drink, do coke, a half-
      dozen in mid-orgy with Hookers, naked in the aisle as
      others pour champagne on them.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 All told, the weekend cost me
                 almost two million dollars--

108   INT. TANGIERS - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY                       *108

      The Tangiers Presidential Suite is a shambles on the           *
      level of Hiroshima. A giant crystal chandelier lays
      shattered on the floor; Jordan asleep in the massive bed,
      a Blue Chip Hooker on either side of him; other passed-
      out BODIES lay amid debris and broken, toppled furniture.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 But the wedding was like something
                 out of a fairy tale--


109   EXT. OCEAN CLUB - BAHAMAS - SUNSET      (DEC `92)              109

      Gorgeous; tropical. Hundreds of FAMILY and FRIENDS
      (Janet, Toby Welch, Peter DeBlasio and Kimmie Belzer)
      look on as Jordan and Naomi walk up the aisle.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
