9    INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT     (FEB `95)                             9

     Jordan, drooling and stoned out of his skull, wears a
     rumpled custom-made business suit as he mans a set of
     controls next to his frantic co-pilot, CAPTAIN DAVE.

                               CAPTAIN DAVE
                Pull up!   Jesus! We're gonna
                crash!!

     Jordan's head bobs as he pulls back on the stick.
     The helicopter rises sharply, then levels out, hovering
     30 feet above a huge mansion. Down below, through
     Jordan's hazy, DOUBLE VISIONED POV, we see a sparkling
     pool, tennis court and waterfall.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                Check this out -- despite my
                completely fucked-up state, I
                could fly straight while still
                seeing two of everything.

     He closes one eye; his POV sharpens. Putting pressure on
     the stick, the helicopter descends slowly over the
     driving range... then LURCHES and SLAMS to the ground.

                              JORDAN
                     (to Captain Dave)
                Ya guzza git hazarous doozy pay,
                buddy.
